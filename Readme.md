# EcoFriendly Github

Github Workflow setup to keep your contribution graph green.

## Working

The workflow runner fetches a random quote and appends it to the quotes.txt file every 12 hours. The changes to the file is then commited and pushed recording a contribution keeping the graph green.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository.
2. clone the forked repository in your local machine or use github codespaces to edit the files.
3. Go to .github/workflows/node.js.yml file.
4. Replace the username and email in line 25 and 26.
5. Make sure you have enabled the read and write permission of workflow setting."Read and write permissions" are enabled in Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions.

## Update

I have disabled the github actions for this repository to prevent it from populating my github graph. So if you fork this repository, you will notice that `workflows` folder is missing in the `.github` folder, which may cause confusion or discrepancy.

Solution: After forking the repository you can simply create `workflows` folder
in your cloned repository and place the `node.js.yml` inside it.

You can just go to this working example: ([Losttrack21/EcoFriendly-GitHub](https://github.com/Losttrack21/EcoFriendly-GitHub)) and generate from template there.
